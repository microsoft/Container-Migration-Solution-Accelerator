class ServiceLifetime:
    """
    Enum-like class defining service lifetime constants for dependency injection.

    This class provides constants for different service lifetimes that determine
    how instances are created and managed by the dependency injection container.

    Constants:
        SINGLETON: Service instances are created once and reused for all requests.
                  Ideal for stateless services or shared resources like database connections.

        TRANSIENT: New service instances are created for each request.
                  Ideal for stateful services or when isolation between consumers is required.

        SCOPED: Service instances are created once per scope (e.g., per request/context) and
               reused within that scope. Automatically disposed when the scope ends.
               Useful for request-specific services that maintain state during a single
               operation but should be isolated between operations.

        ASYNC_SINGLETON: Async singleton with proper lifecycle management.
                        Supports async initialization and cleanup patterns.
                        Created once and supports async context manager patterns.

        ASYNC_SCOPED: Async scoped service with context manager support.
                     Created per scope with automatic async setup/teardown within a scope.

    Usage:
        Used internally by ServiceDescriptor to specify how services should be instantiated
        and managed throughout the application lifecycle. These constants are set when
        registering services via add_singleton(), add_transient(), add_scoped(), etc.

    Example:
        # Used internally when registering services
        descriptor = ServiceDescriptor(
            service_type=IDataService,
            implementation=DatabaseService,

class ServiceScope:
    """
    Manages service resolution within a specific scope context.

    ServiceScope provides a controlled environment for accessing scoped services,
    ensuring proper service lifetime management and scope isolation. This class
    acts as a proxy to the parent AppContext while maintaining scope context
    for accurate service resolution.

    Key Features:
        - Scope-aware service resolution with proper context isolation
        - Thread-safe scope context management
        - Support for both sync and async service resolution
        - Automatic scope context restoration after service resolution
        - Integration with AppContext's scoped service management

    Attributes:
        _app_context (AppContext): Reference to the parent dependency injection container
        _scope_id (str): Unique identifier for this scope instance

    Usage:
        ServiceScope instances are created and managed through AppContext.create_scope().
        They should be used within the context manager pattern for automatic cleanup:

        async with app_context.create_scope() as scope:
            # Services resolved within this scope will be scoped instances
            service = await scope.get_service_async(IMyService)
            another_service = scope.get_service(IAnotherService)

            # Both services will be the same instances if requested again in this scope
            same_service = await scope.get_service_async(IMyService)  # Same instance

        # Scope is automatically disposed after the with block

    Thread Safety:
        ServiceScope manages scope context in a thread-safe manner by temporarily
        setting the scope ID on the parent AppContext and restoring it after
        service resolution. Each scope operation is atomic.

    Performance Notes:
        - Scope context switching has minimal overhead
        - Scoped service instances are cached by the parent AppContext
        - No additional instance storage overhead in ServiceScope itself

    Implementation Details:
        ServiceScope delegates all service resolution to the parent AppContext
        while temporarily setting the scope context. This ensures that the
        AppContext's service resolution logic handles the actual scoped instance
        management and caching.

    Comprehensive dependency injection container with configuration and credential management.

    AppContext serves as the central service container for the application, providing
    a complete dependency injection framework with support for multiple service lifetimes,
    async operations, proper resource cleanup, and Azure cloud integration. This class
    implements enterprise-grade patterns for service management with full type safety.

    Core Features:
        - Multi-lifetime service management: Singleton, Transient, Scoped, and Async variants
        - Type-safe service resolution with full IntelliSense support
        - Fluent API for service registration with method chaining

        - Thread-safe singleton resolution with lazy instantiation

    Service Lifetimes Supported:
        - SINGLETON: One instance per application (cached and reused)
        - TRANSIENT: New instance every time (not cached)
        - SCOPED: One instance per scope context (cached within scope)
        - ASYNC_SINGLETON: Async singleton with lifecycle management
        - ASYNC_SCOPED: Async scoped with automatic cleanup

        _current_scope_id (str): Active scope identifier for context resolution
        _async_cleanup_tasks (List[asyncio.Task]): Async cleanup task tracking

    Service Registration Methods:
        add_singleton(service_type, implementation): Register shared instance service
        add_transient(service_type, implementation): Register per-request instance service
        add_scoped(service_type, implementation): Register per-scope instance service
        add_async_singleton(service_type, implementation): Register async shared service
        add_async_scoped(service_type, implementation): Register async scoped service

    Service Resolution Methods:
        get_service(service_type): Synchronous service resolution with caching
        get_service_async(service_type): Asynchronous service resolution with lifecycle
        is_registered(service_type): Check service registration status
        get_registered_services(): Introspect all registered services

    Scope Management Methods:
        create_scope(): Create isolated service scope context
        _cleanup_scope(scope_id): Internal cleanup for disposed scopes

    Configuration Methods:
        set_configuration(config): Configure application settings
        set_credential(credential): Set Azure authentication credentials

    Advanced Usage Examples:

            .add_singleton(ILogger, ConsoleLogger)
            .add_singleton(IConfiguration, lambda: load_config())
            .add_transient(IRequestHandler, RequestHandler)
            .add_scoped(IDbContext, DatabaseContext)
            .add_async_singleton(IAsyncCache, RedisCache)
            .add_async_scoped(IAsyncProcessor, AsyncProcessor))

        # Service resolution with full type safety
        logger: ILogger = app_context.get_service(ILogger)
        handler: IRequestHandler = app_context.get_service(IRequestHandler)
        cache: IAsyncCache = await app_context.get_service_async(IAsyncCache)

        # Scoped service usage for request isolation
        async with app_context.create_scope() as scope:
            db_context: IDbContext = scope.get_service(IDbContext)
            processor: IAsyncProcessor = await scope.get_service_async(IAsyncProcessor)

            # Services are isolated within this scope
            same_db: IDbContext = scope.get_service(IDbContext)  # Same instance

            # Automatic cleanup when scope exits
            await processor.cleanup()  # Called automatically

        # Service introspection
        if app_context.is_registered(ISpecialService):
            special = app_context.get_service(ISpecialService)

        # View all registered services
        services = app_context.get_registered_services()
        for service_type, lifetime in services.items():
            print(f"{service_type.__name__}: {lifetime}")

    Performance Considerations:
        - Singleton services are cached after first resolution (O(1) subsequent access)
        - Transient services create new instances each time (O(n) instantiation cost)
        - Scoped services are cached within scope context (O(1) within scope)
        - Async services have minimal overhead beyond regular async/await costs
        - Service resolution uses dictionary lookups for optimal performance

    Thread Safety:
        The container provides thread-safe singleton resolution through proper locking.
        Scoped services are designed for single-threaded contexts (per request/task).
        Multiple scopes can exist concurrently in different threads safely.

    Error Handling:
        - Unregistered service resolution raises detailed ServiceNotRegistredException
        - Circular dependency detection prevents infinite loops
        - Async cleanup failures are logged but don't prevent other cleanups
        - Service instantiation errors provide comprehensive diagnostic information

    Azure Integration:
        Built-in support for DefaultAzureCredential enables seamless integration
        with Azure services like Key Vault, App Configuration, and managed identities.
        Configuration and credential objects are automatically available to all services.
