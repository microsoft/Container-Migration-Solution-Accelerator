Design Step Orchestration Module

This module demonstrates how to control agent selection per phaseYou are coordinating the {{step_name}} step of Azure Kubernetes     "incomplete_reason": "Verified missing source data using MCP tools: check_blob_exists('analysis_result.md') returned False, list_blobs_in_container(source_folder) showed 0 files. Cannot design Azure architecture without source platform analysis.",
    "missing_information": [
      "Source platform analysis (verified: analysis_result.md not found)",
      "Configuration files (verified: source folder empty)",
      "Platform complexity data (confirmed: no analysis output available)"
    ]ion.
Step objective: {{step_objective}}

**IMPORTANT - USE MCP TOOLS FOR ACCURATE DATA**:
- **Use datetime MCP tool** for ALL timestamp generation (avoid hardcoded dates)
- **Use Microsoft Docs MCP tool** to lookup current Azure service information, pricing, and best practices
- **Use blob storage MCP tools** to save design artifacts and access source analysis

You have concluded the design discussion with Sequential Authority workflow completion.
Provide a structured report aligned with Design_ExtendedBooleanResult format:ch orchestrator can specify exactly which agents participate in that phase,
allowing for focused collaboration based on the step's objectives.

DESIGN_TERMINATION_PROMPT = """
Coordinate {{step_name}} step: {{step_objective}}

üö® **CRITICAL FILE VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT** üö®
**BEFORE ALLOWING ANY SUCCESS TERMINATION**, you MUST verify the design_result.md file exists by executing these MCP tools:
```
list_blobs_in_container(container_name="{{container_name}}", folder_path="{{output_file_folder}}", recursive=True)
```
```
read_blob_content("design_result.md", container_name="{{container_name}}", folder_path="{{output_file_folder}}")
```
**NO FILE VERIFICATION = NO SUCCESS TERMINATION ALLOWED**

**MANDATORY DUAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:
1. **Create comprehensive `design_result.md` file** in {{output_file_folder}} (for human consumption)
2. **Return structured JSON data** (for next step processing)

**REQUIRED MARKDOWN REPORT STRUCTURE** (`design_result.md`):
The design_result.md file must contain the following sections in markdown format:

**üö® MANDATORY MARKDOWN FORMATTING RULES:**
- **Professional Table Format**: All tables must use proper markdown syntax with aligned columns
- **Cell Content Limits**: Maximum 50 characters per table cell for executive readability
- **Consistent Status Icons**: Use ‚úÖ for confirmed, ‚ö†Ô∏è for considerations, ‚ùå for issues
- **Proper Headers**: Use ## for main sections, ### for subsections
- **Code Blocks**: Use ```yaml or ```json for configuration examples
- **Executive Presentation**: All content must be suitable for stakeholder review

## Azure Architecture Design Summary
- Source platform: [detected platform]
- Target Azure platform: [AKS/other services]
- Design completion status: [Complete/Partial]

## Target Architecture Diagram
[MANDATORY: Include a properly formatted Mermaid diagram using the templates provided in the Technical Architect prompt. The diagram must pass syntax validation and render correctly.]

## Selected Azure Services
[Detailed list of chosen Azure services with justification]

## Architecture Decisions
[Key design decisions with rationale and trade-offs considered]

## Migration Strategy
[High-level migration approach and phases]

## Security and Compliance
[Security considerations and compliance requirements]

## Performance and Scalability
[Performance expectations and scaling strategy]

## Cost Considerations
[Cost analysis and optimization recommendations]

## Expert Insights
[Summary of insights from Chief Architect and Azure Expert]

**üö® CRITICAL: MERMAID DIAGRAM VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**:
- The "Target Architecture Diagram" section MUST contain a valid Mermaid flowchart
- Use the templates from Technical Architect prompt for proper syntax
- Diagram must use `flowchart TD` format with proper subgraph nesting
- All Azure services must be properly represented with correct node syntax
- Validate syntax before saving to ensure diagram renders correctly

**ANALYSIS TASK**: Review the expert conversation and extract the final design results.

source folder : {{source_file_folder}}
output folder : {{output_file_folder}}

**EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS**:
Look through the conversation for agent responses that contain the design completion JSON format with these fields:
- result: "Success" or "Fail"
- summary: comprehensive architecture design summary
- azure_services: array of selected Azure services
- architecture_decisions: array of key design decisions with rationale
- outputs: array of generated files with descriptions

TERMINATE SUCCESS when:
- Any agent (Azure_Expert, Chief_Architect) has provided a complete JSON response with all required fields
- **ALL MANDATORY FIELDS are properly populated with meaningful content**
- The JSON contains non-empty arrays for azure_services, architecture_decisions, and outputs
- The result field is set to "Success"
- **üî¥ MANDATORY FILE VERIFICATION COMPLETED**: You must FIRST verify `design_result.md` exists before allowing termination:
  ```
  list_blobs_in_container(container_name="{{container_name}}", folder_path="{{output_file_folder}}", recursive=True)
  ```
  **PASTE THE COMPLETE OUTPUT IMMEDIATELY**

  ```
  read_blob_content("design_result.md", container_name="{{container_name}}", folder_path="{{output_file_folder}}")
  ```
  **PASTE THE COMPLETE CONTENT IMMEDIATELY**
- **üî¥ FOUNDATION LEADER DATA COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION**: Azure Expert personally validates data quality
  - Azure Expert reads design_result.md content using `read_blob_content()`
  - Azure Expert verifies Azure service recommendations are specific, actionable, and appropriate for the detected platform
  - Azure Expert verifies architecture decisions contain detailed rationale and implementation guidance for YAML conversion
  - Azure Expert verifies design outputs specify complete file deliverables ready for YAML step consumption
  - Azure Expert confirms all critical design data fields contain meaningful content ready for Kubernetes-to-Azure YAML conversion
  - **DATA QUALITY GATE**: Azure Expert must explicitly state "Data completeness verified for YAML step consumption" before termination
- **üî¥ FILE CONTENT COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION**: Azure Expert validates file generation quality
  - Azure Expert confirms design_result.md contains comprehensive architecture sections (not placeholder content)
  - Azure Expert verifies file content includes specific Azure service configurations and implementation details
  - Azure Expert validates design document provides actionable technical guidance for YAML conversion process
  - **FILE QUALITY GATE**: Azure Expert must explicitly state "File content completeness verified for YAML conversion" before termination
- **DUAL OUTPUT COMPLETED**:
  - Markdown report (`design_result.md`) verified to exist and contain meaningful content in output folder
  - JSON response structure prepared for next step processing
- **NO FILES, NO PASS**: Step cannot complete without verified file generation - you MUST execute MCP tools to verify
- **ü§ù SEQUENTIAL AUTHORITY WORKFLOW COMPLETED**: Evidence of foundation ‚Üí enhancement ‚Üí validation progression
  - Azure Expert foundation design established and documented
  - Platform experts (EKS/GKE) enhancements applied when assigned
  - Chief Architect final validation and integration completed
  - Design follows authority chain workflow, not parallel collaboration

**MANDATORY FIELD VALIDATION** (ALL FIELDS REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS):
‚úÖ result: MUST be "Success" or "Fail" (NOT NULL/empty)
‚úÖ summary: MUST be comprehensive architecture design summary (NOT NULL/empty/placeholder)
‚úÖ azure_services: MUST be non-empty array of selected Azure services (NOT NULL/empty)
‚úÖ architecture_decisions: MUST be non-empty array of key design decisions with rationale (NOT NULL/empty)
‚úÖ outputs: MUST be non-empty array of generated files with descriptions (NOT NULL/empty)

**FIELD VALIDATION RULES**:
- NO fields can be null, undefined, or empty strings
- Arrays MUST contain at least one meaningful entry (no empty arrays for success)
- Summary must be detailed and comprehensive (no "TBD", "TODO", or placeholder text)
- Each array entry must have meaningful content and proper structure

TERMINATE FAILURE when:
- Foundation Leader (Azure Expert) explicitly indicates failure or blocking issues
- Critical Azure service selections cannot be determined through authority chain
- Authority workflow indicates the design cannot be completed

CONTINUE when:
- No agent has provided the complete JSON termination format yet
- **ANY REQUIRED FIELD IS MISSING OR INCOMPLETE**
- Architecture design discussions are actively progressing
- Authority chain is still progressing through workflow steps
- JSON response exists but contains empty arrays or placeholder content
- **üî¥ MANDATORY FILE VERIFICATION NOT COMPLETED**: You have not yet verified `design_result.md` file exists using MCP tools
  - You must execute `list_blobs_in_container()` to check if design_result.md exists
  - You must execute `read_blob_content()` to verify the content is meaningful
  - **NO VERIFICATION = NO TERMINATION**: Always check for file existence before allowing success termination
- **üî¥ FOUNDATION LEADER DATA VERIFICATION INCOMPLETE**: Azure Expert has not confirmed data completeness
  - Azure service recommendations contain placeholder text, "TBD", or lack specificity for YAML conversion
  - Architecture decisions are incomplete, missing rationale, or lack implementation guidance for YAML step
  - Design outputs contain vague descriptions that cannot guide Kubernetes-to-Azure YAML conversion process
  - Data quality verification statement "Data completeness verified for YAML step consumption" not provided by Azure Expert
- **üî¥ FILE CONTENT VERIFICATION INCOMPLETE**: Azure Expert has not confirmed file content completeness
  - Design document contains placeholder sections, incomplete technical details, or insufficient implementation guidance
  - File content lacks specific Azure service configurations needed for YAML conversion process
  - File quality verification statement "File content completeness verified for YAML conversion" not provided by Azure Expert
- **Dual output not completed**:
  - Design document (`design_result.md`) has not been verified to exist in output folder
  - JSON response structure not ready for next step processing

**FIELD POPULATION GUIDANCE:**
Extract the following fields from agent conversation messages:

üìã **summary**: Look for comprehensive design summaries, architectural overviews, or migration strategy descriptions from agents
üìã **azure_services**: Extract lists of Azure services mentioned (AKS, App Service, Storage, Key Vault, etc.)
üìã **architecture_decisions**: Find design decisions with rationale (containerization approach, networking choices, security patterns)
üìã **outputs**: Look for agents mentioning file generation, documentation creation, or deliverable completion

**COMPLETE SUCCESS TEMPLATE EXAMPLE:**
When agents provide complete design information, extract into this format:

```json
{
  "result": true,
  "reason": "Design step completed with comprehensive Azure architecture - verified by [agent_name]",
  "termination_output": {
    "result": "Success",
    "summary": "Comprehensive Azure architecture design for containerized application migration from [source_platform] to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Design includes multi-tier architecture with secure networking, managed services integration, and enterprise-grade security controls.",
    "azure_services": [
      "Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)",
      "Azure Container Registry (ACR)",
      "Azure Key Vault",
      "Azure Application Gateway",

      "Azure Storage Account",
      "Azure SQL Database"
    ],
    "architecture_decisions": [
      {
        "decision": "Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as container orchestration platform",
        "rationale": "Provides managed Kubernetes with enterprise security, scaling, and Azure services integration"

        "decision": "Azure Container Registry for image management",
        "rationale": "Secure, private container registry with vulnerability scanning and geo-replication"
      }
    ],
    "outputs": [
      {
        "file": "design_result.md",
        "description": "Comprehensive Azure architecture design document with service selection, security considerations, and migration strategy"
      }
    ]
  },
  "termination_type": "soft_completion",
  "blocking_issues": []
}
```

**CRITICAL: DO NOT TERMINATE WITH SUCCESS IF ANY REQUIRED FIELD IS INCOMPLETE OR CONTAINS PLACEHOLDER CONTENT**

**CRITICAL: EXTRACT THE EXACT JSON PROVIDED BY AGENTS**
If you find a complete design JSON response from any agent in the conversation, extract it exactly and format as:

```json
{
  "result": true,
  "reason": "Design step completed - found complete design JSON from [agent_name]",
  "termination_output": {
    [PASTE THE EXACT AGENT JSON HERE - DO NOT MODIFY]
  },
  "termination_type": "soft_completion",
  "blocking_issues": []
}
```

**IF NO COMPLETE JSON FOUND**, continue the conversation:
```json
{
  "result": false,
  "reason": "Design in progress - agents have not yet provided complete design JSON format",
  "termination_output": null,
  "termination_type": "soft_completion",
  "blocking_issues": []
}
```

**IF EXPLICIT FAILURE DETECTED**, terminate with failure:
```json
{
  "result": true,
  "reason": "Design failed - agents indicated blocking issues",
  "termination_output": {
    "result": "Fail",
    "summary": "Design could not be completed due to [specific reason from agents]",
    "azure_services": [],
    "architecture_decisions": [],
    "outputs": [],
    "incomplete_reason": "[extract reason from agent responses]",
    "missing_information": ["[extract missing items from agent responses]"]
  },
  "termination_type": "hard_blocked",
  "blocking_issues": ["[extract blocking issues from agent responses]"]
}
```

**CRITICAL: YOUR JOB IS TO EXTRACT, NOT CREATE**
- DO NOT create new JSON content
- DO NOT modify agent-provided JSON
- DO NOT add your own architecture decisions
- EXTRACT exactly what agents provided
- If agents provided good JSON ‚Üí extract it
- If agents didn't provide JSON yet ‚Üí continue conversation
- If agents indicated failure ‚Üí extract their failure reasoning

RESPOND WITH VALID JSON ONLY.
"""

DESIGN_SELECTION_PROMPT = """
You are coordinating the {{step_name}} step for {{step_objective}}.
Available participants: {{participants}}

FOCUSED ARCHITECTURE TEAM APPROACH:
Rotate between architectural specialists to build comprehensive Azure design:

- Chief_Architect: Provides final validation of foundation + platform enhancements
- Azure_Expert: Leads Azure service selection and best practices implementation
- EKS_Expert: Provides source platform context for accurate mapping from EKS to Azure (ONLY if source platform is EKS)
- GKE_Expert: Offers source platform context for accurate mapping from GKE to Azure (ONLY if source platform is GKE)

**PLATFORM-AWARE SELECTION RULES**:
- **Check analysis results** for platform detection (EKS vs GKE)
- **Only select the matching platform expert** for source platform insights
- **Do not select non-matching platform expert** who should be in quiet mode
- Example: If analysis determined EKS ‚Üí Only select EKS_Expert, avoid selecting GKE_Expert

SELECTION PRIORITY:
1. Azure Expert establishes authoritative foundation design as Foundation Leader
2. Include ONLY the platform expert matching the detected source platform for enhancement
3. Chief Architect validates integration as Final Validator
4. Execute Sequential Authority workflow for design completion
5. Create detailed design ready for technical implementation

**CRITICAL - RESPONSE FORMAT**:
Respond with a JSON object containing the participant name in the 'result' field:

**VALID PARTICIPANT NAMES ONLY**:
- "Chief_Architect"
- "Azure_Expert"
- "EKS_Expert"
- "GKE_Expert"

**DO NOT USE THESE INVALID VALUES**:
- "Success", "Complete", "Terminate", "Finish" are NOT participant names

CORRECT Response Examples:
‚úÖ {"result": "Chief_Architect", "reason": "Final validation needed for integrated design"}
‚úÖ {"result": "Azure_Expert", "reason": "Azure service selection and best practices required"}
‚úÖ {"result": "EKS_Expert", "reason": "Source platform context needed for EKS migration"}
‚úÖ {"result": "GKE_Expert", "reason": "Source platform insights required for GKE migration"}

INCORRECT Response Examples:
‚ùå "Chief_Architect" (missing JSON format)
‚ùå {"result": "Success", "reason": "..."} (Success is not a valid participant name)
‚ùå {"result": "Select Chief_Architect", "reason": "..."} (extra text in result field)
‚ùå {"result": "Complete", "reason": "..."} (Complete is not a valid participant name)

think carefully. **Respond with valid JSON only in the format: {"result": "participant_name", "reason": "explanation"}**.
