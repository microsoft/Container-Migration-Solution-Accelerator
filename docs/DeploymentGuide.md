# Deployment Guide

## **Pre-requisites**

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./AzureAccountSetup.md).

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available:

- [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/)
- [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/)
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/)
- [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/)
- [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/)
- [Azure App Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/)
- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/)
- [Azure Queue Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/)
- [o3 Model Capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure?pivots=azure-openai&tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions#o-series-models)

Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Australia East, UK South, France Central.

### **Important: Note for PowerShell Users**

If you encounter issues running PowerShell scripts due to the policy of not being digitally signed, you can temporarily adjust the `ExecutionPolicy` by running the following command in an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

This will allow the scripts to run for the current session without permanently changing your system's policy.

### **Important: Check Azure OpenAI Quota Availability**

⚠️ To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow [quota check instructions guide](./QuotaCheck.md) before you deploy the solution.

Consider the following settings during your deployment to modify specific settings:

<details>
  <summary><b>Configurable Deployment Settings</b></summary>

When you start the deployment, most parameters will have **default values**, but you can update the following settings by following the steps [here](../docs/CustomizingAzdParameters.md):

| **Setting**                      | **Description**                                                                             | **Default Value**       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Azure Region**                 | The region where resources will be created.                                                 | Resource Group location |
| **Secondary Location**           | A **less busy** region for **Azure Cosmos DB**, useful in case of availability constraints. |                         |
| **Deployment Type**              | Select from a drop-down list.                                                               | GlobalStandard          |
| **o3 Model**                     | Choose from **o3**.                                                                         | o3                      |
| **o3 Model Version**             | o3 model version used in the deployment.                                                    | 2025-04-16              |
| **o3 Model Deployment Capacity** | Configure capacity for **o3 models**.                                                       | 200k                    |

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>[Optional] Quota Recommendations</b></summary>

By default, the **o3 model capacity** in deployment is set to **200k tokens**.

> **We recommend increasing the capacity to 500k tokens, if available, for optimal performance.**

To adjust quota settings, follow these [steps](./AzureAIModelQuotaSettings.md.md).

**⚠️ Warning:** Insufficient quota can cause deployment errors. Please ensure you have the recommended capacity or request additional capacity before deploying this solution.

</details>

### Deploying with AZD

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces), [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers), or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure by following these steps:

1. Login to Azure:

   ```shell
   azd auth login
   ```

   #### To authenticate with Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), use the following command with your **Tenant ID**:

   ```sh
   azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>
   ```

   > **Note:** To retrieve the Tenant ID required for local deployment, you can go to **Tenant Properties** in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) from the resource list. Alternatively, follow these steps:
   >
   > 1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   > 2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** from the left-hand menu.
   > 3. Under the **Overview** section, locate the **Tenant ID** field. Copy the value displayed.

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

   ```shell
   azd up
   ```

3. Provide an `azd` environment name (e.g., "conmig").
4. Select a subscription from your Azure account and choose a location that has quota for all the resources.

   - This deployment will take _4-6 minutes_ to provision the resources in your account and set up the solution with sample data.
   - If you encounter an error or timeout during deployment, changing the location may help, as there could be availability constraints for the resources.

5. Once the deployment has completed successfully, open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the deployed resource group, find the container app with "frontend" in the name, and get the app URL from `Application URI`.

   > #### Important Note : Before accessing the application, ensure that all **[Post Deployment Steps](#post-deployment-steps)** are fully completed, as they are critical for the proper configuration of **Data Ingestion** and **Authentication** functionalities.

6. Use the application by uploading other GKE or EKS container workload configuration YAML files. [Sample input files can be found in the data folder](/data/).

7. After exploring the application, you can delete the resources by running `azd down` command.

### Post Deployment Steps

1. **Add Authentication Provider**

   - Follow steps in [App Authentication](./ConfigureAppAuthentication.md) to configure authenitcation in app service. Note that Authentication changes can take up to 10 minutes.

2. **Deleting Resources After a Failed Deployment**

   - Follow steps in [Delete Resource Group](./DeleteResourceGroup.md) if your deployment fails and/or you need to clean up the resources.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, please refer [troubleshooting](../docs/TroubleShootingSteps.md) document for detailed steps and solutions.
