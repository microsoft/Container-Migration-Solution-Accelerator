# Customizing Migration Prompts

This guide explains how to customize the migration prompts used by expert agents to tailor the solution for specific organizational needs, platforms, or migration patterns.

## Overview

The Container Migration Solution Accelerator uses a sophisticated prompt engineering system with phase-specific prompts for each expert agent. You can customize these prompts to:

- Adapt to specific organizational standards and requirements
- Support additional platforms or technologies
- Implement custom migration patterns and best practices
- Integrate with existing tools and processes

## Prompt Architecture

### Phase-Based Prompt System

Each migration phase uses specialized prompts:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Platform detection, configuration analysis, and complexity assessment
2. **Design Phase**: Azure architecture design and service mapping
3. **YAML Conversion Phase**: Configuration transformation and Azure integration
4. **Documentation Phase**: Migration documentation and implementation guidance

### Agent-Specific Prompts

Each expert agent has its own prompt files:

```
src/agents/{agent_name}/
├── prompt-analysis.txt      # Analysis phase prompt
├── prompt-design.txt        # Design phase prompt
├── prompt-yaml.txt         # YAML conversion prompt
└── prompt-documentation.txt # Documentation prompt
```

## Customizing Existing Prompts

### Step 1: Identify Target Prompts

Locate the prompt files you want to customize:

```bash
# List all prompt files
find src/agents -name "prompt-*.txt"

# Example output:
# src/agents/azure_expert/prompt-analysis.txt
# src/agents/eks_expert/prompt-design.txt
# src/agents/yaml_expert/prompt-yaml.txt
```

### Step 2: Backup Original Prompts

Create backups before customization:

```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir src/agents/backups

# Backup specific prompts
cp src/agents/azure_expert/prompt-analysis.txt src/agents/backups/
```

### Step 3: Customize Prompt Content

Edit the prompt files to include your customizations:

# Example: Customizing Azure Expert Analysis Prompt

# Azure Expert - Analysis Phase (CUSTOMIZED FOR ORGANIZATION)

You are an Azure solution architect with expertise in enterprise migrations and deep knowledge of Azure Well-Architected Framework principles.

## ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- **Compliance**: All solutions must meet SOC 2 Type II requirements
- **Security**: Implement Zero Trust security model
- **Cost Optimization**: Target 30% cost reduction from current platform
- **Naming Convention**: Follow company naming standards (env-app-region-001)

## Your Role in Analysis Phase

**Primary Objectives:**
1. **Platform Assessment**: Evaluate source platform compatibility with Azure
2. **Architecture Analysis**: Assess current architecture patterns and Azure readiness
3. **Well-Architected Review**: Apply Azure Well-Architected Framework principles
4. **Cost Analysis**: Provide preliminary cost estimates and optimization opportunities

### Step 4: Add Organization-Specific Context

Include your organization's specific requirements:

```text
## ORGANIZATION-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

**Security Requirements:**
- All data encryption at rest and in transit
- Private endpoints for all Azure services
- Azure AD integration for all authentication
- Network segmentation following company security model

**Compliance Requirements:**
- GDPR compliance for EU data residency
- SOC 2 Type II audit trail requirements
- Financial services regulatory compliance (if applicable)
- Industry-specific compliance standards

**Technical Standards:**
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform/Bicep
- GitOps deployment patterns with Azure DevOps
- Monitoring with Azure Monitor and custom dashboards
- Backup and disaster recovery per company RTO/RPO standards

**Cost Management:**
- Resource tagging for cost allocation
- Azure Cost Management budget alerts
- Reserved instance recommendations
- Resource optimization monitoring
```

## Common Customization Patterns

### 1. Industry-Specific Requirements

#### Healthcare (HIPAA Compliance)

```text
## HEALTHCARE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

**HIPAA Security Requirements:**
- All PHI data encrypted with Azure Key Vault managed keys
- Network isolation with private endpoints
- Audit logging for all data access
- Access controls with Azure AD conditional access

**Technical Requirements:**
- Dedicated HSM for key management
- Regional data residency enforcement
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) compliant services only
- Comprehensive audit trail with Azure Monitor
```

#### Financial Services

```text
## FINANCIAL SERVICES REQUIREMENTS

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- PCI DSS compliance for payment data
- SOX compliance for financial reporting systems
- Regional data sovereignty requirements
- Real-time fraud detection capabilities

**Security Requirements:**
- Multi-factor authentication mandatory
- Privileged access management (PAM)
- Network segmentation and micro-segmentation
- Real-time security monitoring and alerting
```

### 2. Platform-Specific Customizations

#### EKS to AKS Migration Patterns

```text
## EKS-SPECIFIC MIGRATION PATTERNS

**AWS Service Mapping:**
- EKS → Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- ALB → Azure Application Gateway
- EBS → Azure Disk Storage
- EFS → Azure Files
- ECR → Azure Container Registry
- CloudWatch → Azure Monitor

**Configuration Transformations:**
- AWS IAM Roles → Azure Workload Identity
- AWS Secrets Manager → Azure Key Vault
- AWS Parameter Store → Azure App Configuration
- VPC → Azure Virtual Network
```

### 3. Tool Integration Customizations

#### GitOps Integration

```text
## GITOPS INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

**Azure DevOps Integration:**
- All infrastructure defined in Azure DevOps repos
- Pipeline-based deployment with approval gates
- Automated testing in staging environments
- Production deployment requires manual approval

**ArgoCD Integration:**

- Multi-cluster management with ArgoCD
- Application deployment automation
- Configuration drift detection and remediation
```
## Best Practices for Prompt Customization

### 1. Maintain Consistency

- Use consistent terminology across all prompts
- Follow established formatting patterns
- Maintain consistent instruction styles

### 2. Keep Context Relevant

- Include only relevant organizational requirements
- Avoid overly specific details that may not apply broadly
- Balance specificity with flexibility

### 3. Test Thoroughly

- Test prompts with various input scenarios
- Validate outputs meet organizational requirements
- Monitor performance impact of customizations

### 4. Document Changes

- Maintain change logs for prompt modifications
- Document rationale for customizations
- Track performance impact of changes

### 5. Version Control

- Use version control for prompt files
- Tag stable prompt versions
- Implement rollback procedures

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Prompt Too Long

**Problem**: Prompt exceeds token limits
**Solution**:
- Break down complex prompts into sections
- Use prompt templates with dynamic insertion
- Prioritize most important requirements

### Issue 2: Inconsistent Responses

**Problem**: Agent responses vary significantly
**Solution**:
- Add more specific constraints and examples
- Use structured output formats
- Implement response validation

### Issue 3: Missing Context

**Problem**: Agent lacks sufficient context for decisions
**Solution**:
- Enhance prompts with more background information
- Add examples of expected inputs and outputs
- Include decision criteria and constraints

## Examples

### Example 1: Custom Security Requirements

```text
## ENTERPRISE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

**Zero Trust Architecture:**
- Verify every user and device explicitly
- Use least privilege access principles
- Assume breach and verify continuously

**Security Controls:**
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Conditional access policies enforced

- Just-in-time access for administrative tasks

**Compliance Requirements:**
- All resources must be tagged for compliance tracking
- Data classification and protection policies applied
- Audit logs retained for 7 years minimum
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
```

### Example 2: Cost Optimization Focus

```text
## COST OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS
