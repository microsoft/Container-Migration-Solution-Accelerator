# Container Migration Solution Accelerator: Responsible AI FAQ

## What is the Container Migration Solution Accelerator?

This solution accelerator is an open-source GitHub Repository designed to streamline the migration of Kubernetes workloads from various container platforms (EKS, GKE, etc.) to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It automates the analysis, design, configuration transformation, and documentation generation processes to enhance the speed and accuracy of container platform migrations. The solution is built using Azure OpenAI Service, Semantic Kernel Process Framework, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and Azure services integration.

## What can the Container Migration Solution Accelerator do?

The solution is designed for DevOps Engineers, Platform Engineers, and Cloud Architects who need to migrate containerized applications between different Kubernetes platforms. The solution processes source Kubernetes configurations through a multi-step pipeline:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Automatically discovers YAML configuration files, detects source platform types (EKS, GKE, etc.), and analyzes workload complexity and dependencies.

2. **Design Phase**: Generates Azure-specific architecture recommendations, suggests appropriate Azure services (AKS, Azure Container Registry, Azure Key Vault, etc.), and creates migration strategies tailored to the detected workloads.

3. **YAML Transformation Phase**: Converts source platform configurations to Azure-compatible YAML files, integrates Azure-specific services, and validates the transformed configurations.

4. **Documentation Phase**: Produces comprehensive migration documentation including architecture diagrams, implementation guides, troubleshooting documentation, and post-migration validation steps.

The solution utilizes multi-agent AI orchestration to ensure comprehensive analysis and recommendations, with each phase handled by specialized expert agents (EKS Expert, GKE Expert, Azure Expert, YAML Expert, Technical Writer, etc.).

## What is/are the Container Migration Solution Accelerator's intended use(s)?

This repository is to be used only as a solution accelerator following the open-source license terms listed in the GitHub repository. The intended purpose is to demonstrate how organizations can:

- Accelerate container platform migrations to Azure
- Reduce manual effort in analyzing complex Kubernetes configurations
- Generate standardized migration documentation and architecture recommendations
- Ensure best practices are followed during Azure migrations
- Provide a repeatable, consistent migration process

**Important**: The output is for informational and planning purposes only and should always be reviewed by qualified engineers before implementation. All generated configurations and recommendations must be validated in non-production environments before deployment.

## How was the Container Migration Solution Accelerator evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The solution was evaluated using multiple approaches:

1. **AI Safety Evaluation**: Testing for harmful content generation, groundedness of recommendations, and potential security risks in generated configurations.

2. **Technical Accuracy**: Validation of generated YAML configurations against Azure AKS standards and Kubernetes specifications.

3. **Migration Coverage**: Testing across different source platforms (EKS, GKE) and various workload types (stateless applications, databases, monitoring systems, etc.).

4. **Process Framework Reliability**: Evaluation of the Semantic Kernel Process Framework's error handling, retry mechanisms, and failure recovery capabilities.

5. **Documentation Quality**: Assessment of generated documentation for completeness, accuracy, and actionability.

Performance metrics include:

- Configuration transformation accuracy rates
- Platform detection precision
- Documentation completeness scores
- Process execution success rates
- Error classification and recovery effectiveness

## What are the limitations of the Container Migration Solution Accelerator? How can users minimize the Container Migration Solution Accelerator's limitations when using the system?

### Key Limitations

1. **AI-Generated Content Accuracy**: AI-generated configurations and recommendations may contain inaccuracies and must be thoroughly reviewed by qualified engineers before implementation.

2. **Platform Coverage**: While the solution supports major platforms (EKS, GKE to AKS), it may not handle highly customized or proprietary Kubernetes distributions.

3. **Complex Workload Dependencies**: The solution may not fully capture complex inter-service dependencies, custom operators, or platform-specific integrations.

4. **Security Context**: Generated configurations may not fully account for organization-specific security policies, compliance requirements, or network restrictions.

5. **Language Support**: Currently available in English only and optimized for standard Kubernetes YAML configurations.

### Minimizing Limitations

1. **Human Validation**: Always have qualified Kubernetes and Azure engineers review all generated configurations and recommendations.

2. **Staged Migration**: Implement a phased migration approach, starting with non-critical workloads to validate the process.

3. **Testing Environment**: Deploy all generated configurations in a testing environment that mirrors production before actual migration.

4. **Custom Validation**: Supplement the solution with organization-specific validation rules and security scanning.

5. **Expert Review**: Engage with Azure specialists and Kubernetes experts to review migration plans and architecture recommendations.

6. **Backup and Rollback**: Ensure robust backup and rollback procedures are in place before executing migrations.

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the Container Migration Solution Accelerator?

### Configuration Parameters

Users can customize various parameters to improve accuracy and relevance:

1. **AI Model Settings**: Temperature, max tokens, and system prompts for different expert agents can be adjusted through environment variables.

2. **Agent Behavior**: Each expert agent (Azure Expert, EKS Expert, YAML Expert, etc.) has configurable prompts that can be tailored to organizational standards.

3. **Validation Rules**: Custom validation logic can be implemented to check against organization-specific compliance requirements.

4. **Output Formats**: Documentation templates and YAML transformation rules can be customized to match organizational standards.

5. **MCP Plugin Configuration**: Model Context Protocol servers can be configured for specific Azure integrations and data sources.

### Best Practices

1. **Environment Isolation**: Run the solution in isolated environments with appropriate access controls.

2. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging and telemetry to track all AI-generated recommendations and decisions.

3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the solution updated with the latest Azure service definitions and Kubernetes best practices.

4. **Feedback Loop**: Implement mechanisms to capture feedback from migration outcomes to improve future recommendations.

5. **Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning tools to validate generated configurations against security policies.

6. **Documentation Review**: Establish processes for technical review of all generated documentation before use.

### Important Security Considerations

- Never include sensitive data (secrets, keys, passwords) in source configurations processed by the solution
- Review all generated configurations for potential security misconfigurations
- Validate network policies and access controls in generated Azure configurations
- Ensure compliance with organizational data handling and AI usage policies

Please refer to the latest Azure and Kubernetes documentation for detailed configuration guidance, and consult with your Microsoft account team or Azure specialists for implementation assistance.
